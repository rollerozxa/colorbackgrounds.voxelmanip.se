		<h1>Colored Desktop Backgrounds</h1>

		<p>This is a site which contains a collection of pure colors that can be set as your desktop background wallpaper. Simply save the color you want as an image and set it as your wallpaper.</p>

		<p>Most of the colors are taken from the standard <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color">HTML color names</a>, but there are also some special ones.</p>

		<p>While some operating systems have a built-in way to choose an arbitrary color value to use as your desktop wallpaper, some only offer a limited selection of basic colors to pick from. You can of course also use the hex color codes associated with each visible color too.</p>
